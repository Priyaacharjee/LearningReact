1. **Link** is used in place of **a** tag, but we should not use this tag because it reloads the whole page again and again, **NavLink** prevents this.
1. **Propdrilling** does not help much, we should use a global file to access the data instead of prop passing. 

**Context API** exists only on react
**Redux**(stackathon library) helps in state management,means the data passing from here and there it manages it in a organized way.

in react - react-redux, Redux-toolkit(RTK)
